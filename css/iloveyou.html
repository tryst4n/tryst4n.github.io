            <div class="col sectionText">Hey my love. I know this was supposed to be our anniversary gift and I'm sorry
                I couldn't
                deliver it in time. I'm still unsure when you'll be able to read this but I hope with all my heart that
                when you do, we'll be just fine and that everything will be okay. Things haven't been the easiest these
                past months and I still want to remind you everyday that I love you so much Amy. You light up my day
                when I see you, and every moment I get to spend with you are the happiest of my life. Sometimes I feel
                like I'm so ungrateful to be with you, but I want to tell you that I am so so relieved that we got the
                chance to be together. I couldn't ask for anything more than to live and grow up with you. I
                truly don't know what I would do without you and I never want to go through it. I want to spend the rest
                of my life by your
                side Amy. I want to buy a house with you so that we can wake up every morning together. I want to have a
                thousand cats together, attend all these weddings together and just be able to hug and kiss you
                everyday. There's not a thing in this world that could make me doubt how much I love you. It's always
                been you baby. You're the love of my life and I'll never ever think about leaving us again. I promise my
                love. I promise you more than anything in this world. I don't want to go through a single day like today
                again where I feel like we're not together anymore. Everything in my heart tells me that you're the one
                for me and that there'll never be something like us again. You're my soulmate lovey. You're my love,
                you're my baby, you're the one I want to take care of for the rest of my life. We're so meant for
                each other and I won't let anything ever break it again. I love you so much

                <p>These are some pictures of the moments we have spent together. They mean the
                    world to me and I wanted to group them up somewhere so that we can relive them like they were
                    yesterday.
                    I hope you'll never forget the fun we've had and all these special memories that we've built
                    together. Open it baby :)</p>
